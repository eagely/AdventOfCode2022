My solutions for Advent of Code 2022 using Kotlin

This is a fully complete project that you can run by executing gradle run.

To insert your input navigate to src/main/resources and insert a file named "InputD$day.aoc" where $day is the day number.
Example: "InputD13.aoc" containing the *raw* data from https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/13/input
This file has to contain the *raw* input from adventofcode.com and minor changes *may* cause it to break.

I will implement a parser so you don't have to manually input your data soon!

If the solution doesn't exist I haven't made or pushed it yet but will do soon!
